Monthly Meetups
In order to continue building connections between members on campus, we'll be hosting monthly meetups for all of you interested in data science. These meetups will be informal and feature a few short talks about a variety of topics relevant to our organization. They will happen on the second Wednesday of every month at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (190 Doe Library). <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> if you want to give a talk!

Starting a Career in Data Science
Our first event was a panel discussion and networking mixer with former academics who have successfully transitioned into data science careers. Our panelists were Caroline Sofiatti (Noon Home), Lenny Evans (Uber), Nathan Lande (Rally Health), and Kevin O'Sullivan (Grammarly).
