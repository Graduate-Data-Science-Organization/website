I founded the graduate data science organization to address a need to provide resources for graduate students to start a career in data science.  I am currently pursuing my PhD in Artificial Intelligence research, specifically Deep Learning and Machine Learning.  In addition to my research, I have been involved with many outside Data Science projects and industry internships.

I'm a PhD student in the Physics department, studying Type Ia supernovae as tools for measuring the expansion history of the Universe and investigating the nature of dark energy. My research makes use of many data science tools and techniques, but I try to expand my skill set with side projects and hackathon submissions too. I pull myself away from my computer to ride my bike and go to concerts around the Bay Area.

I study novel parameter estimation schemes and apply them to interesting models in physics and theoretical neuroscience. I got involved with the GDSO to connect with other graduate students who are also interested in using their skills and expertise to tackle problems outside of academia. To maintain my sanity, I enjoy traveling and photography.

I am a PhD Student in the UCB UCSF Joint Bioengineering Program, currently studying host response to infectious diseases using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics approaches. I enjoy tackling challenging informatics projects and am passionate about applying large data analysis to improve human health. I am simultaneously excited by the possibilities enabled by application of similar analysis techcniques to day-to-day life. Outside of work, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and hiking.

Iâ€™m currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Nuclear Science Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory studying the behavior of nuclear matter at temperature and pressure extremes that resemble the state of the universe instants after the big bang. To study the short-lived fireball produced in heavy ion collisions we leverage a variety of statistical and machine learning tools to reconstruct probes that travel a mere fraction of the width of human hair before decaying. Outside of work I enjoy playing squash, riding my bike and exploring the bay area.

I am a PhD student that studies the bacteria of the human microbiome by applying machine learning and statistics to sequencing data. Outside of my PhD research, I utilize my data science skill set by doing industry internships and working on side projects. I am particularly excited about my one of my side projects, which uses biometrics and blockchain technology to securely provide emergency responders with a person's medical data. In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, cooking, traveling, and teaching beginners how to code.
