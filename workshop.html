                        <h1>Data Science Workshop</h1>
                        <p>The Data Science Workshop is a three-week program where small teams of graduate students and postdocs are paired with mentors from industry to work on an outstanding problem in data science. The workshop is completely free of charge. It was developed to address an issue that was highlighted by a number of our guests from the CDIPS Speaker Series: “The gap between academic science and industry is often narrow but deep. Many of the skills you may lack are seen as necessary by an employer, but can be easily learned.”</p>
 
                        <p>This is the sixth year of the workshop, and the last five workshops have been a immensely successful. Workshop participants have gone on to work for companies such as Google, Twitter, Uber, Bayes Impact, Cisco Meraki, Rhumbix, Sojern, Kanjoya, 6sense, Bolt Threads, and ATP Endeavors! Many former participants have become Insight Data Science Fellows.</p>
 
                        <p>The workshop aims to provide participants with 3 things:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Familiarity with common practices and concepts in data science</li>
                                <li>A concrete experience to show employers</li>
                                <li>Contacts in data science</li>
                            </ul>
